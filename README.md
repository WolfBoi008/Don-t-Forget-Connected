# Archipelago Manual: Don't Forget Connected
## Notes
- The latest version, as of the time of writing, is 2.7.15. 2.8.0 isn’t out yet, and neither is 3.0.0, the upcoming major updates for this game.
- If you're unfamiliar with the late game, I'd **extremely** recommend excluding the later Weapon and Armor Chests, since they can take a long time to get (the last ones require LV 60, but the latest Goal currently requires only LV 20).
